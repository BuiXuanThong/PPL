        In D96 programming language, there is only one type of comment: block comment. A block
        comment starts with ## and ignores all characters (except EOF) until it reaches the nearest
        ##. All characters in a block comment will be ignored.
        For example:
        ## This is a
        multi-line
        comment.
        ##
